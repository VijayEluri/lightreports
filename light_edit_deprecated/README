#####################################################################

###################
 Quick Start Usage:
###################

 *GENERAL*
 ----------
	Install: The best way to install and use Light is to install all of the files into 
	c:\usr\local\projects\light_edit (/usr/local/projects/light_edit on Linux) directory.
	
	For example, light_edit is LIGHT_HOME:
	
		Z:\>cd "c:\usr\local\projects\light_edit"
		Z:\>dir
		...
		...
		CHANGELOG
		TODO
		conf
		...

	Java Runtime 1.5 or greater is required.
	
	This information does require you do anything on your part, but they may be useful
	if you have issues:	
	Java executables found in the light.bat script file.
		set _RUNJAVA="%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java"
		set _RUNJAVAW="%JAVA_HOME%\bin\javaw"
		set _RUNJAVAC="%JAVA_HOME%\bin\javac"
		...
		...
		
		%_RUNJAVA% %JAVA_OPTS% -classpath "%CLASSPATH%" -Dlight.install.dir="%INSTALL_DIR"
		 
 *WIN32*
 ---------
 	In a win32 environment (Cygwin or through the Windows Command Line), the best way to launch
 	Light is to execute the light.bat batch script
 	
 	Z:\> light.bat  (or ./light.bat in cygwin)
