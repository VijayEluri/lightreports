 * Date: 1/5/2009
 *       7/15/2009 - Added Clojure 1.0, other performance fixes and cleanups.
 *       
 * Main Description: Light Log Viewer is a tool for making it easier to search log files.  
 * Light Log Viewer adds some text highlighting, quick key navigation to text files, simple graphs 
 * and charts for monitoring logs, file database to quickly navigate to files of interest, 
 * and HTML to PDF convert tool.  
 * Light Log was developed with a combination of Clojure 1.0, Java and Scala with use of libs, SWT 3.4, JFreeChart, iText. 
 * 
 * Quickstart : the best way to run the Light Log viewer is to click on the win32 batch script light_logs.bat
 * (you may need to edit the Linux script for Unix/Linux environments).
 * Edit the win32 script to add more heap memory or other parameters.
 * 
 * The clojure source is contained in : HOME/src/octane
 * The java source is contained in :  HOME/src/java/src
 * 
 * To build the java source, see : HOME/src/java/build.xml and build_pdf_gui.xml
 * 
 * Metrics: (as of 7/15/2009) Light Log Viewer consists of 6500 lines of Clojure code, and contains wrapper code
 *  around the Java source.  There are 2000+ lines of Java code in the Java library for Light Log Viewer.
 *  
 * Additional Development Notes: The SWT gui and other libraries are launched from a dynamic classloader.  Clojure is also
 *   started from the same code, and reflection is used to dynamically initiate Clojure. See the 'start' package.  The binary
 *   code is contained in the octane_start.jar library.
